# Intro
CIS556 Databases Course (UMICH).

The Course project is STARRS application for Database University.

# Summary
The project is to implement an on-line admissions and graduation clearance system for graduate students applying 
to the University. 

The current system allows students to apply online but the process by which the faculty reviews the applications 
is a paper process. For simplicity, in this project your team will design and build a system that will automate 
the workflow process in the admissions, registration and graduation system for Masterâ€™s degree students. 

You can implement this project using any DBMS the team has access to, you must be able to demo the application 
in the final presentation.
